A small calculator program I made.

This is nothing powerful, as division only goes to 6 decimal places, and I don't intend for it to go further.
It is pretty self-explanatory, just run the .exe file, and follow the on screen instructions.
This is a command line application, so you can either run it from a terminal using `./tryhardcal.exe`, or run it from double click.


This code has no licensing, feel free to use it as you wish, without contribution.
I didn't put enough time into this to feel a need to put a license on it.
